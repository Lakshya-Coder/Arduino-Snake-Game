# Arduino Snake Game 🐍

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using an Arduino board. The game is played on a 0.96 inch oled display.

## Prerequisites 📋
Before diving into the game, make sure you have the following components:
- Arduino Nano board 🕹️
- Breadboard 🍞
- 0.96-inch OLED display 🖥️
- Joystick (For controlling the game) 🕹️
- Passive Buzzer 🔊
- Lithium-ion battery (Optional) 🔋
    
## Connections 🔌
Let's connect everything together for a smooth experience:
- Connect the GND of the joystick, buzzer, and OLED display to GND.
- Connect the VCC or +5V of the joystick and OLED display to 5V.
- Connect the SCK of the OLED display to A5.
- Connect the SDA of the OLED display to A4.
- Connect the SW pin of the joystick to A3.
- Connect the VRX pin of the joystick to A2.
- Connect the VRY pin of the joystick to A1.
- Finally, connect the positive pin of the buzzer to D10.

## Installation 🚀
Ready to play? Just follow these steps:
* Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
* Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
* Install the Adafruit_SSD1306 library if you haven't already. You can install it using the Arduino Library Manager or manually by following the instructions provided by the library.
* Open the `Arduino_Snake_Game.ino` file i(![Uploading Screenshot-1.jg…])n the Arduino 
* Make connections based on the above instrustions
* Upload the sketch to your Arduino board. And voila! It's game time! 🎉
